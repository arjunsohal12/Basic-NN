# Basic-NN
Basic neural network created using python coded from scratch. Also includes a basic U.I. explaining the network

The network itself was created using a backpropegation algorithm, designed to represent the first number of a simple dataset created using 1's and 0's. It was designed 
to provide a simple introduction to machine learning, while showing how to code its functions from scratch.
